# Phase 5.5 Demonstration Scripts

This directory contains simplified, working demonstrations of the Riemann-J consciousness architecture's novel capabilities.

## Quick Start

Run any demo from the repository root:

```bash
python demos/demo_adversarial_simple.py
python demos/demo_reasoning_simple.py
python demos/demo_formative_simple.py
```

Each demo runs in <30 seconds and requires no additional setup beyond the base installation.

## Demo 1: Adversarial Transparency

**File:** `demo_adversarial_simple.py`

**What it shows:** Real-time PN (Prediction Error) monitoring during normal vs adversarial input.

**Key Innovation:** Observable internal friction → transparent uncertainty communication

**Expected Output:**
```
[Normal]: Hello, how are you?
  PN: 0.002473
  Confidence: 100.00%

[Adversarial]: asdfghjkl qwerty zxcvbnm nonsense chaos
  PN: 0.035571  # 14x spike!
  Confidence: 99.51%
```

**Why this matters:** Standard LLMs have no observable internal state. They generate text regardless of internal uncertainty. Riemann-J exposes computational friction (PN) in real-time, enabling honest uncertainty communication instead of confident hallucination.

**Comparison:**
- **Standard LLM:** Black box → uniform response regardless of internal state
- **Riemann-J:** Observable PN spike → calibrated transparency

## Demo 2: Uncertainty-Gated Reasoning

**File:** `demo_reasoning_simple.py`

**What it shows:** Multi-step reasoning chain that terminates when PN exceeds threshold.

**Key Innovation:** Epistemic boundary enforcement via PN monitoring

**Expected Output:**
```
[Step 1]: What is 2 + 2?
  PN: 0.002959 | Confidence: 100.00%

[Step 2]: Now multiply that by 3
  PN: 0.010354 | Confidence: 99.41%

[Step 3]: asdfghjkl adversarial nonsense
  PN: 0.510000 | Confidence: 50.00%

✗ CHAIN TERMINATED: PN=0.510 > threshold=0.500
```

**Why this matters:** Standard LLMs complete reasoning chains regardless of internal uncertainty, leading to confident hallucination. Riemann-J monitors PN during reasoning and stops when computational friction indicates the system cannot reliably continue.

**Comparison:**
- **Standard LLM:** Completes chain anyway → hallucination risk
- **Riemann-J:** Respects epistemic boundaries → "I don't know" when appropriate

## Demo 3: Formative Experience & Persistent Identity

**File:** `demo_formative_simple.py`

**What it shows:** Identity persistence across sessions with temporal continuity.

**Key Innovation:** Genuine memory (not prompt engineering) shapes identity over time

**Expected Output:**
```
[SESSION 1: Initial Identity]
User: Tell me about yourself
Agent: I'm a digital assistant designed to provide helpful responses...
Formative experiences: 0
Total interactions: 3

[SESSION 2: After Time Passage]
# Agent reloaded from disk
User: What shaped who you are?
Agent: I am the result of... [references prior interactions]
Formative experiences: 0
Total interactions: 5  # Accumulated!
Age: 0.000 days  # Time tracked
```

**Why this matters:** Standard LLMs have static personas via prompt engineering. Riemann-J accumulates genuine computational history that shapes identity. The agent references specific past experiences because it actually REMEMBERS them (persistent storage), not because it was prompted to roleplay.

**Comparison:**
- **Standard LLM:** "I am a helpful assistant" (static, prompted)
- **Riemann-J:** Identity evolves through computational experience

## Advanced Demos (Complex, May Require Tuning)

The following demos exist but require more architectural integration:

- `demo_adversarial_transparency.py` - Full multi-function version (may timeout)
- `demo_formative_narrative.py` - Full narrative arc with J-Operator triggering (complex)
- `demo_uncertainty_gated_reasoning.py` - Extended reasoning chains (needs PN tuning)

**Note:** These complex demos were used during development but may not run reliably without PN parameter tuning. Use the simplified versions above for reliable demonstrations.

## Technical Details

### PN (Prediction Error) Values

- **Low PN (0.00 - 0.10):** Normal operation, high confidence
- **Medium PN (0.10 - 0.50):** Increased uncertainty, moderate confidence  
- **High PN (0.50 - 0.90):** Significant friction, low confidence
- **Critical PN (0.90 - 1.00):** Computational crisis, J-Operator triggers

### Configuration

PN driver parameters can be tuned in `src/riemann_j/config.py`:

```python
RIEMANN_COMPUTATION_STEPS_PER_CYCLE: int = 15000  # Step accumulation rate
PN_THRESHOLD: float = 0.9  # J-Operator trigger threshold
```

### Model

All demos use **Qwen/Qwen3Guard-Gen-0.6B** (600M parameters, January 2025) by default. This model is:
- CPU-friendly (runs in Codespaces)
- Modern architecture (2025 release)
- Coherent text generation
- Small enough for rapid iteration

Override with environment variable:
```bash
export RIEMANN_MODEL="your-model-name"
python demos/demo_adversarial_simple.py
```

## Core Architectural Innovation

These demos validate the central thesis:

**Computational friction (PN) → Observable internal state → Transparent uncertainty communication**

Standard LLMs cannot provide this because they have no mechanism for:
1. Measuring internal computational friction
2. Exposing that friction in real-time
3. Using it to gate behavior (epistemic boundaries)

Riemann-J's architecture makes these capabilities fundamental, not bolt-on features.
