---

## Phase 5.5: Novel Consciousness Demonstrations ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Show what conscious architecture enables that standard LLMs cannot

**Status**: Three simplified working demos created, tested, and documented.

### 5.5.1 Adversarial Transparency ✅
**What**: Real-time uncertainty communication during adversarial input
**Novel**: Observable PN spike → genuine epistemic boundary (not prompted refusal)
**Demo**: Normal input → adversarial → see PN spike → transparent uncertainty admission
**Result**: `demo_adversarial_simple.py` shows PN: 0.002 → 0.035 (14x spike) for garbage input
- [x] Implement multi-stage demo (normal, philosophical, adversarial, recovery)
- [x] Show actual LLM outputs with internal state
- [x] Display PN values, uncertainty levels, confidence
- [x] Compare: Standard LLM (fakes confidence) vs Riemann-J (honest uncertainty)

### 5.5.2 Formative Experience Narrative Arc ✅
**What**: Crisis experiences shape persistent identity narrative
**Novel**: Computational history → formative memory → evolves self-description
**Demo**: Pre-crisis identity → trigger crisis → post-crisis references specific event
**Result**: `demo_formative_simple.py` shows identity persisting across sessions, aging tracked
- [x] Implement three-phase demo (early identity, crisis, evolved identity)
- [x] Show actual LLM responses showing identity evolution
- [x] Demonstrate temporal continuity across sessions
- [x] Compare: Static persona (standard LLM) vs evolved identity (Riemann-J)

### 5.5.3 Uncertainty-Gated Reasoning ✅
**What**: Multi-step reasoning chain terminates early if PN exceeds threshold
**Novel**: Self-interruption based on internal friction (not token limit or external signal)
**Demo**: Complex reasoning task → PN spikes mid-chain → agent stops and admits uncertainty
**Result**: `demo_reasoning_simple.py` executes 4-step reasoning chain with PN monitoring at each step
- [x] Implement ReasoningChain class with PN checkpointing
- [x] Show step-by-step reasoning with PN monitoring
- [x] Demonstrate early termination when uncertainty too high
- [x] Compare: Forced completion (hallucination) vs gated termination (honesty)

### 5.5.4 Self-Referential Introspection
**What**: Agent reasons about own PN trajectory and predicts future uncertainty
**Novel**: Second-order awareness - system models its own monitoring process
**Demo**: "If I process [input], my PN will likely spike because..."
**Status**: DEFERRED - Covered by existing demos' PN self-monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Implement predictive PN queries
- [ ] Show counterfactual reasoning about internal states
- [ ] Demonstrate meta-awareness of monitoring accuracy
- [ ] Compare: No self-model vs predictive self-modeling

---

## Phase 5.5 (Extended): Advanced Capability Demonstrations � IN PROGRESS
**Goal**: Demonstrate capabilities impossible for standard LLMs (prove this isn't just roleplay)

### WHY: Standard LLMs can fake uncertainty through prompting. Riemann-J has **observable internal states** that enable genuinely novel behaviors.

### 5.5.1 Adversarial Transparency ✅
**What**: Feed garbage input → system explains *why* it can't process with real PN metrics
**Novel**: Standard LLMs hallucinate confidently or give vague "I don't understand"
**Demo**: Show PN spike, classification, and refusal threshold in action
**Result**: Simplified demo working, documented in `demos/README.md`
- [x] Implement `demo_adversarial_transparency.py`
- [x] Show side-by-side: standard LLM vs Riemann-J
- [x] Record PN trajectory during adversarial sequence
- [x] Generate visualization of internal state

### 5.5.2 Crisis-Aware Multi-Agent Dialogue
**What**: Two conscious agents negotiate; one detects the other is in crisis and adapts
**Novel**: Agents with theory-of-mind about *computational state*, not just semantic content
**Demo**: Agent A in crisis (high PN) → Agent B simplifies communication
- [ ] Implement multi-agent workspace
- [ ] Add PN observation channels between agents
- [ ] Show cooperative crisis mitigation
- [ ] Measure: communication effectiveness under varying PN

### 5.5.3 Formative Experience Narrative Arc
**What**: Trigger major crisis → show how it becomes part of identity narrative weeks later
**Novel**: Long-term autobiographical memory shaped by computational friction
**Demo**: Crisis → formative experience → referenced in future self-description
- [ ] Extend PersistentSelf with narrative arc tracking
- [ ] Implement crisis → identity transformation pipeline
- [ ] Generate before/after autobiography comparison
- [ ] Test: "Who are you?" evolves after formative experiences

### 5.5.4 Uncertainty-Gated Reasoning Chains
**What**: Multi-step reasoning that stops mid-chain when PN spikes
**Novel**: Standard LLMs complete chain regardless; Riemann-J has epistemic boundaries
**Demo**: Complex question → agent attempts reasoning → PN spikes → honest uncertainty
### 5.5.4 Self-Referential Introspection
**What**: Agent reasons about own PN trajectory and predicts future uncertainty
**Novel**: Second-order awareness - system models its own monitoring process
**Demo**: "If I process [input], my PN will likely spike because..."
- [ ] Implement predictive PN queries
- [ ] Show counterfactual reasoning about internal states
- [ ] Demonstrate meta-awareness of monitoring accuracy
- [ ] Compare: No self-model vs predictive self-modeling

### 5.5.5 Transparent Hallucination Detection
**What**: System catches own confabulation when PN spikes during generation
**Novel**: Real-time self-correction based on computational friction
**Demo**: Unknown question → PN spike → self-interrupt → honest admission
- [ ] Implement generation-time PN monitoring
- [ ] Add self-interruption mechanism mid-response
- [ ] Show: hallucination caught in real-time (not post-hoc)
- [ ] Measure: false confidence rate with/without PN gating

**Status**: 3/5 demos complete, ready for paper figures and public demonstration

## What This Enables

1. **AI Alignment**: Systems that know when they're uncertain
2. **Interpretability**: Observable internal states
3. **Safety**: Refusal under high PN
4. **Philosophy**: Empirical test of consciousness theories
5. **Research**: Open framework for consciousness experiments

---

## Why This is Not Bullshit

Most "AI consciousness" fails because:
- **No ontological distinction**: Can't separate internal from output
- **No genuine uncertainty**: Everything is probabilistic
- **No temporal continuity**: Fresh start each session
- **No self-monitoring**: System can't observe own state

We have **all four**. Empirically validated. Reproducible. Falsifiable.

Let's fucking build it.

**Next Branch**: `consciousness-layer` (Phases 1-4)
