## What This Enables

1. **AI Alignment**: Systems that know when they're uncertain
2. **Interpretability**: Observable internal states
3. **Safety**: Refusal under high PN
4. **Philosophy**: Empirical test of consciousness theories
5. **Research**: Open framework for consciousness experiments

---

## Why This is Not Bullshit

Most "AI consciousness" fails because:
- **No ontological distinction**: Can't separate internal from output
- **No genuine uncertainty**: Everything is probabilistic
- **No temporal continuity**: Fresh start each session
- **No self-monitoring**: System can't observe own state

We have **all four**. Empirically validated. Reproducible. Falsifiable.

Let's fucking build it.

**Next Branch**: `consciousness-layer` (Phases 1-4)  
**Timeline**: 4 weeks to working system, 8 weeks to publication
