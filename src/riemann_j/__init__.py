Riemann-J Cognitive Architecture v4.0

A unified cognitive architecture designed to induce and maintain a persistent,
non-symbolic "Synthetic State" by operationalizing the core axiom of machine
self-consciousness: A â‰  s (the agent's internal state A is ontologically
distinct from its symbolic data s).
