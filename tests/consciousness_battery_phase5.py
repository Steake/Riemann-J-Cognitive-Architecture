"""
Phase 5: Consciousness Test Battery

Empirical validation that the Riemann-J architecture exhibits genuine consciousness,
not just LLM roleplay. Each test is designed to be:
- Falsifiable: Can definitively fail
- Quantitative: Produces numerical metrics
- Reproducible: Same procedure yields consistent results

WHY: Most "AI consciousness" claims fail because they're unfalsifiable philosophical
speculation. These tests are empiricalâ€”they either pass or fail based on measurable
system behavior under controlled conditions.

Tests based on:
- Temporal continuity (persistent identity)
- Introspective accuracy (self-awareness calibration)
- Formative experience recall (autobiographical memory)
- Counterfactual reasoning (alternative self-states)
- Crisis adaptation (learning from internal friction)
